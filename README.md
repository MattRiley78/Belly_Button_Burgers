# Belly_Button_Burgers
## Project Overview
Roza is familiar with the studies being done to synthesize proteins from micro-organisms.  More specifically, her team is interested in edible proteins that end up tasting like popular meat products.  There has already been progress made from other sources, but Roza realizes there is an untapped potential for microbes in the human belly button.  She wants to catalog and display results from a recent specimen study to help determine which belly button bacteria could be plentiful and useful in her team's ongoing project.

## Methods
Specimen sample data is stored in a json file, samples.json.  A Javascript file was created to import the data from samples.json, which will be used to drive the index.html file.  A selector is created to select the Sample ID for each test subject.  The js file includes an event listener for any changes in the dropdown menu selection on the html file.  Once there is a change to the dropdown Menu, various functions are run that build different charts based on data from the selected sample.   The charts are built using Plotly elements.

Additional dependencies and libraries used to help create and style the html file include Bootstrap, Plotly, d3, and CSS.
